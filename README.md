# Data Visualization Dashboard Panel

## Building an interactive data visualization dashboard in Python using Panel

This repository contains code based on [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhxiXOTKzfs) I followed. The channel's case study is about visualizing CO2 Emissions and Climate Change.

First, I'll follow the instruction and secondly, add new case study as for my portofolio project.

[Panel](https://panel.holoviz.org/) is an open-source Python library that lets you create custom interactive web apps and dashboards by connecting user-defined widgets to plots, images, tables, or text.

Compared to other approaches, Panel is novel in that it supports nearly all plotting libraries, works just as well in a Jupyter notebook as on a standalone secure web server, uses the same code for both those cases, supports both Python-backed and static HTML/JavaScript exported applications, and can be used to develop rich interactive applications without tying your domain-specific code to any particular GUI or web tools.

Panel makes it simple to:

- Use the PyData tools and plotting libraries that you know and love
- Develop in your favorite editor or notebook environment and seamlessly deploy the resulting application
- Iterate quickly to prototype apps and dashboards while offering polished templates for your final deployment
- Support deep interactivity by communicating client-side interactions and events to Python
- Stream data large and small to the frontend
- Add authentication to your application using the inbuilt OAuth providers
